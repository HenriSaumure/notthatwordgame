# Not That Word Game

flutter frontend for the Wordle game

uses the current word of the day from the real game!

enjoy :)

## TODOs

- [ ] Save game events to file, to keep progression if the app closes
- [ ] Add a fully offline mode
- [ ] Integrate a web service for sharing games (leaderboard with friends?)
